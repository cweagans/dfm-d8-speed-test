[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cweagans/dfm-d8-speed-test.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cweagans/dfm-d8-speed-test)

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate the differences in speed in running
Docker in various methods. This is mostly targeted at Mac usage, but there is a
Linux benchmark included for comparison.
